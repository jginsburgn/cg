# Computer Graphics Course Repo

This repository contains all relevant files of my Computer Graphics class. It includes example code from the lecturer, deliverables from assignments and class presentations. It is organized in disconnected branches:

1. [course-material](tree/course-material): contains the raw lecture presentations and sample codes.
1. a{[1](tree/a1-basic-figures),[2](tree/a2-3d-figures),[3](tree/a3-solar-system),[4](tree/a4-bunny-hopping),[5](tree/a5-robot-invaders),[6](tree/a6-not-star-fox)}-*: contain the deliverables for all assignments of the course, along with their instructions.
1. [dirty-solar-system](tree/dirty-solar-system): contains a precursor to [clean solar system](https://github.com/jginsburgn/solar-system).
1. [old-master](tree/old-master): contains very similar (probably the same) files to the dirty-solar-system branch. Checking needs to happen and elimination, if proper (this chore has been indefinitely posponed).
