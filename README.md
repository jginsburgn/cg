# ðŸš½ Dirty Computer Graphics Solar System Simulation

A precursor to the [*Solar System Simulation*](https://github.com/jginsburgn/solar-system). Dirty work ðŸ’©.

## How to Run?

Launch a web server and make the repo's root directory the document root of the site. Navigate to it within a browser and see code live.

## Code Insight

The directory ending with `-wg` contains an attempt of simulating the Earth-Moon system with actual gravitational forces. The directory `solar-system` is a fixed orbit simulation of the Solar System. The `libs` directory has libraries that are shared in both simulation attempts.
